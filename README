MagicWiki
=========

Designed to make static page generation and editing a joy rather than a pain.

Features include:
 - Wiki style code interpretation
 - Dynamic page creation
 - Easy linking and embedding facilities
 - In-place editing

Todo list includes:
 - User auth

Requires:
 - Haml

=========

To Use:
 - install via git as a plugin
 - run the migration scripts (easiest way is using my easy_migrate plugin)
 - make a before filter that sets @magic_wiki_editable to true when you want a user to be able to edit a page
 - browse to yourapp.com/wiki/WikiPageName

To embed in existing pages:
 - put "include MagicWiki" in your controller file
then in your page def put:
 - magic_wiki_do_setup "WikiPageName"
 - @wiki = magic_wiki_display
then in your view put either:
 - "= @wiki" for haml users
 - "<%= @wiki %>" for erb users

=========

Notes:
 - go to wiki/Ref for a reference to the wiki syntax
